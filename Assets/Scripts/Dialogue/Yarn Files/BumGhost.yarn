Bum Ghost: Ah, hello there. Quite a place you got here, seems like you have a lot of influences from a bunch of different places... positively cosmopolitan.
Bum Ghost: ...My name? Well, when I went to the Grim Reaper and couldn't decide on a name, he just called me 'Indecisive Ghost'.
<<emotionChange Annoyed Scribbles>>
Bum Ghost: Unfortunately, the folks here seem to like to call me 'Bum Ghost'.
<<emotionChange None>>
Bum Ghost: I know, REAAAL flattering, ain't it?
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Bum Ghost: Just cause I look like one and never got a job don't mean you gotta point it out all the time.
Bum Ghost: Anyway, back to you. You seem to have all sorts of interests... a bit indecisive on how your cafe looks too, aren't you?
Bum Ghost: Hm? You wanted to talk to me about ideas?
<<emotionChange Ponder Flowers>>
Bum Ghost: Hmm... well, I'd say you should go full into the plant theme, like a plant cafe and- no, wait: what if you went more historical?
Bum Ghost: Like having that weirdo who likes columns... no... ah, wait, what if...
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Bum Ghost: ...
<<emotionChange None Scribbles>>
Bum Ghost: I probably just made you more indecisive... I'm sorry.
Bum Ghost: You probably figured it out by now, but that's why the good ol' G.R. calls me 'Indecisive Ghost'... since I am obviously indecisive. 
Bum Ghost: There I go again, messing up someone else's good ideas and never-
<<emotionChange Smug Flowers>>
Bum Ghost: Oh! You... liked that? I... I must say I am surprised. Nobody's ever liked it when I start rambling about random stuff.
<<emotionChange None>>
Bum Ghost: Thanks, C.G... I'll think about what you said.

Bum Ghost: Hi hi, it's me again. I wanted to talk to you about last time.
Bum Ghost: Sorry if I got a bit off-topic last time, but sometimes it feels nice to let myself ramble. It's not so much that I just like the sound of my own voice... I just like to live in the realm of ideas.
<<emotionChange Ponder>>
Bum Ghost: Have you ever heard an academic talk?
Bum Ghost: Sometimes, they'll say that the reason that academia is so appealing is because it allows them to explore the world of concepts, ideas, theory, things like that...
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Bum Ghost: You... want to hear about my life?
<<emotionChange Annoyed>>
Bum Ghost: I... really don't think it's worth talking about, there wasn't much there, after all. It also isn't particularly happy.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Bum Ghost: Not everybody died with a big story or with a smile on their face. 
Bum Ghost: I never had the means went through life not being able to figure anything out for myself, then I died because somebody wasn't looking where he was going and crashed into me.
Bum Ghost: It isn't a happy story.
Bum Ghost: Strange, isn't it? The world is so big and filled with ideas, concepts, people, things, and yet... I didn't ever get a chance to do anything in it.
Bum Ghost: You... don't think it's bad that I never figured myself out?
Bum Ghost: Hah, you sound just like my folks. They always supported my stupid ideas...
Bum Ghost: I'll... get back to you. I need to think about some things. Catch you later... uhm... Cafe.

Bum Ghost: Howdy. I'm back.
Bum Ghost: I thought about what you said earlier, and I wanted to try again. If you'd be okay with it, could I talk about my life again?
Bum Ghost: I... thought about it, and I believe I haven't been entirely forthright with the way that I presented my life earlier.
Bum Ghost: Thank you... let's see... I was born poor, that much is true, but we lived near a college campus.
Bum Ghost: The people there were nice and I was allowed to audit a bunch of lectures even though I didn't formally attend.
Bum Ghost: My dad was a carpenter, and so I usually helped him make things to make ends meet, but when I had nothing to do, I went to the college. Eventually on my 20th birthday, my parents surprised me with... tuition.
Bum Ghost: I know, not exactly the most exciting thing, but it made me, just, unfathomably happy.
<<emotionChange Ponder>>
Bum Ghost: I took all sorts of classes in all sorts of disciplines, I learned about... just about everything.
Bum Ghost: Mathematics, science, western and eastern classics, music, tech, computer science, anatomy, rudimentary law... everything.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Bum Ghost: Yet, even as my parents and advisors pushed me to choose something... I just couldn't. I wanted to learn more, explore more. By the time I realized my money ran out? It was already too late.
Bum Ghost: I didn't live long after that, that truck driver made sure of that. When I died, I realized I had a lot of time to think about my life, but I also got to compare my life to other people's lives.
Bum Ghost: It isn't hard to see why I might think mine was miserable compared to other people's after all.
Bum Ghost: You... don't think it was miserable that I never became anything? Why?
Bum Ghost: Was I happy? Of course I was.
<<emotionChange Smug>>
Bum Ghost: Even when I didn't actually attend the college, I still got to hear about what the professors said, and I still got to make friends and talk to them.
Bum Ghost: That's... all that matters? I see, so that's how you think... interesting. I have to ponder that.
Bum Ghost: Thanks for listening, Caf-Caf, I really do appreciate your time. I'll see you soon.

Bum Ghost: Greetings again, C.G. I was thinking the other day about my life, and I think you were right.
Bum Ghost: Still, I don't agree that happiness is everything, but it certainly doesn't help if I keep telling myself it sucked, no?
Bum Ghost: Besides, all of the ghosts here have a reason for being here, right?
Bum Ghost: They all have problems, and they're all dissatisfied in some way. Now, I maintain that my reasons are a bit more... dire than other reasons, but I suppose it's all about perspective.
<<emotionChange Ponder>>
Bum Ghost: What I'm trying to say is... thanks, Caf-Caf. Thanks for listening to me, and thanks for talking with me. You're a great guy, y'know that? A really helpful little soul.
Bum Ghost: What am I gonna do now?
<<emotionChange Smug Sparkles>>
Bum Ghost: Aren't you nosy, Cafe. Kidding, kidding.
<<emotionChange Ponder>>
Bum Ghost: I think... I want to stay here and watch what the ghosts do.
Bum Ghost: That tycoon monocle dude wants to make something, and he even got the column guy to help. I want to wander for a bit... until my metaphorical legs tire.
Bum Ghost: I think... I think I miss my parents. They're not gone yet... but one day they will come.
<<emotionChange Smug>>
Bum Ghost: When they do... I wanna disappear with them. I don't know what comes next, but I want to confront whatever it is with them.
Bum Ghost: Thanks, Caf. I'll be seeing you.
