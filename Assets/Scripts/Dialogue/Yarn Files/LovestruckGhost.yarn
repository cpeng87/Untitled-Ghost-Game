Lovestruck Ghost: Oh... I don't think this is what I asked for. I don't think my date would be impressed...

Lovestruck Ghost: Sorry, don't mean to pry, but are you interested in anyone? Romantically of course!
Lovestruck Ghost: Old habits... I used to be quite good at setting people up on dates! 
Lovestruck Ghost: All my friends would come to me for dating advice... and it seemed to work for them!
Lovestruck Ghost: Hm? Oh, no, I never dated anyone myself. Never seemed to be able to find the right person.
Lovestruck Ghost: I'd like to, though...doesn't everyone? Romance just sounds so dreamy...
Lovestruck Ghost: Let me know if anyone else is a romance fan, I'd love to get to know them!

Lovestruck Ghost: Someone confessed to me, before I died. It was my best friend, actually! Totally caught me off guard. 
Lovestruck Ghost: I didn't even know what to say. I told them I needed some time to respond, but then, well...I guess I never did. 
Lovestruck Ghost: I've had a lot of time to think about it but I still don't really know what I would have said. 
Lovestruck Ghost: If there was anyone I was going to fall in love with, it would have been them - they were everything I ever wanted. But I didn't. 
Lovestruck Ghost: I guess that spark just wasn't there...
Lovestruck Ghost: Ah! Sorry, I've just been sitting here and taking up your time... Thanks for listening!

Lovestruck Ghost: Hi again! Oh, you found someone who wants to meet me? Oh...I...Thank you, but I think I have to turn them down. 
Lovestruck Ghost: I've been thinking a lot lately, and I've realized that I...I think I liked the idea of falling in love more than I actually really wanted to.
Lovestruck Ghost: Everyone always seemed so happy when I helped matchmake them, yknow? And I wanted that for myself. 
Lovestruck Ghost: But I think I'm happy, right now. And maybe I don't need to fall in love just because everyone around me does.
Lovestruck Ghost: Maybe I never even really wanted to.
Lovestruck Ghost: Here, I've got some bittersweet chocolates.
Lovestruck Ghost: I always wanted to give this to a crush, but I think you should have it.
Lovestruck Ghost: Thanks for always listening to me.
