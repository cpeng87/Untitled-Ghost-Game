Doctor Ghost: You know, this small little shop really reminds me of the coffee shop near the medical school I attended.
<<emotionChange Happy Flowers>>
Doctor Ghost: The barista there always had a huge smile on her face as she gave everyone their orders. She messes up a few times, but she always tries her best.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Doctor Ghost: You know, it always amazes me how much someone's life can change through someone else's actions.
<<emotionChange Concern>>
Doctor Ghost: As a doctor, I've treated so many patients. Some of them were old, barely hanging on to life but still fighting to stay with their loved ones as long as possible.
Doctor Ghost: Others were young, hurt by things out of their control. People of all ages and backgrounds all come to the hospital for the same purpose, for another chance at life.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Doctor Ghost: Whenever I see their smile or the smile of their loved ones, I realize how much I changed their lives.
Doctor Ghost: When I was young, I never could have imagined what direction my life would go. But it was all thanks to a stranger that I became who I am today.
Doctor Ghost: I hope I can find them one day so I can thank them.
<<emotionChange Happy Flowers>>
Doctor Ghost: Keep up the good work, I'm sure it will all pay off one day.

Doctor Ghost: Hey... Have you seen... Never mind.
Doctor Ghost: This shouldn't be something I should bother you with. If you wish to know, however, I'm looking for a certain soldier.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Doctor Ghost: He was the stranger I mentioned last time. I heard from some other ghosts that he might have been seen here.
Doctor Ghost: I... I have to find him.
Doctor Ghost: He was the reason why I lived to be a doctor.
Doctor Ghost: Why I... even got a chance live in the first place.
<<emotionChange Concern>>
Doctor Ghost: I had an illness when I was young. And because our village didn't have a doctor, I was certain I was going to die.
Doctor Ghost: But when our village was attacked by some enemies, that soldier saved me
Doctor Ghost: I didn't want his sacrifice to be in vain, so I pushed myself to live.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Doctor Ghost: When relief came and the doctors there cured me, I dedicated myself to become a doctor as well.

Doctor Ghost: I finally found him! The Soldier!
<<emotionChange Concern>>
Doctor Ghost: I'm so glad I was able to find him, though it seemed like he had forgotten all about me.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Doctor Ghost: I didn't recognize him at first, but the dog tag he had was the one the soldier who saved me had, so it must be them!
Doctor Ghost: He tried to be humble when I thanked him for what he did, but there's no way I could just brush it off!
<<emotionChange Happy Flowers>>
Doctor Ghost: He was the one who motivated me to keep going! To live for others! If it weren't for him, I would have either died by those enemy soldiers or died from my illness.
<<emotionChange Normal Flowers>>
Doctor Ghost: I.. I think I'm ready to move on now that I was able to say my thanks.
Doctor Ghost: I'm really glad that this place existed.
Doctor Ghost: Thank you for the drinks. I'm sure that they helped change some people's lives for the better.
