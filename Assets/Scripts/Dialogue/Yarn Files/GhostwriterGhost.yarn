Ghostwriter Ghost: Oh, wait, you're talking to me?
<<emotionChange None Flowers>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: Yes! <wiggle> Hi!! </wiggle> I see you run this cafe - I wrote a story about a cafe romance once, you know?
Ghostwriter Ghost: It wasn't anything great, and I wasn't happy with it, but you know cafe stories are all the rage nowadays, so it would sell...
<<emotionChange None>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: Oh, not that I'm some money-chaser or anything!
<<emotionChange Sad>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: It's just, well, I also need to eat...
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: But I used to come to places like this all the time to write!
Ghostwriter Ghost: The author I worked for also liked cafes, so we often met over coffee or something.
Ghostwriter Ghost: What?
Ghostwriter Ghost: Oh, my author? Well, I'm a ghostwriter, after all.
Ghostwriter Ghost: I write the work, my author puts her name on it, and it gets shipped out!
Ghostwriter Ghost: Hey, have you ever read anything I've written?
Ghostwriter Ghost: Maybe "Battle and Tranquility"? Or "Small Cottage on the Meadow"?
<<emotionChange None Flowers>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: <wiggle> Oh, yes, I wrote those! </wiggle>
Ghostwriter Ghost: I'm so happy you know them, I loved writing those so much!
<<emotionChange None>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: Did - do you know my name? I was listed as, uh, an editor on those books, I think - under the acknowledgements, for sure!
<<emotionChange Sad>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: - no? ...well, no one remembers anyone except the author, of course.
Ghostwriter Ghost: I shouldn't be surprised.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: I'm really - quite fine with this, of course! I don't do well with fame, and the spotlight, and all. Yeah.

Ghostwriter Ghost: Hi again!
Ghostwriter Ghost: ...Hm, you want to know why I kept ghostwriting instead of publishing?
<<emotionChange Sad>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: Well, you see... when I first started as a writer, I couldn't get anyone to publish my work.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: None of my works got any offers, and I just really, <italic> really </italic> wanted for people to be able to read my work.
Ghostwriter Ghost: I didn't care that it was under a different name, at the time.
<<emotionChange Sad>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: I...I'm not sure when I suddenly started caring.
Ghostwriter Ghost: Well, I did want recognition.
Ghostwriter Ghost: I wanted so badly to talk to the people I've inspired, to be able to speak publicly about my experience writing, to see that I had done something for the world, and have other people tell me that too.
Ghostwriter Ghost: And, well, I'm still frustrated about it.
Ghostwriter Ghost: That I never got to do that, that I never had the courage to become an author all on my own.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: But...maybe it's not too late to?

Ghostwriter Ghost: Hey, do you think I should start writing again?
Ghostwriter Ghost: No one will read it but ghosts, of course, but...I miss writing.
Ghostwriter Ghost: Sometimes I forget why I became a writer in the first place - it wasn't for money, or fame, or recognition, even if that's what I died wishing for.
Ghostwriter Ghost: I just wanted to write, and for someone to read my work, and feel touched.
<<emotionChange None Flowers>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: And - people did, right? Lots of people! Even if it wasn't my name.
Ghostwriter Ghost: Maybe that's enough.
Ghostwriter Ghost: Maybe, now that I can write under my own name, I'll feel like it's enough.
<<emotionChange None>>
Ghostwriter Ghost: I owe a lot to you for listening to me talk. It might not seem like much to you, but it helped me a bunch.
Ghostwriter Ghost: I think it's time I let myself be happy with what I've accomplished.
