Wizard Ghost: Ah, you want to know about me, dear mortal? Ohoho, I'm glad you've asked!
<<emotionChange None Sparkles>>
Wizard Ghost: You may call me <wiggle> Emrys, master of the arcane arts! </wiggle>
<<emotionChange None>>
Wizard Ghost: Say, have you ever thought about doing an apprenticeship in sorcery? I can show you the world in its purest form!
<<emotionChange None Sparkles>>
Wizard Ghost: Spectacle!
Wizard Ghost: Discovery!
Wizard Ghost: Third adjective!
<<emotionChange None>>
Wizard Ghost: Yes, yes, I see it now - The look in your eyes!
<<emotionChange Magic>>
Wizard Ghost: You want to be my pupil, no? Ah, wait - You are skeptical of who I say I am!
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Wizard Ghost: Yes, yes, a fair choice to be wary. But, I promise you, dear mortal, that I am truthful about my knowledge of this world.
Wizard Ghost: In fact, when I return to this cafe, I shall show you some of my teachings!
Wizard Ghost: That will prove my status, and will empower you to unlock your true potential!
Wizard Ghost: I must be going now, but I shall see you again soon, dear mortal!

Wizard Ghost: Hello once again, dear mortal! It is I, Emrys, yet again!
Wizard Ghost: Are you ready to begin your first lesson?
<<emotionChange None Sparkles>>
Wizard Ghost: Today, I shall teach you... <wiggle> spellcasting! </wiggle>
<<emotionChange None>>
Wizard Ghost: We shall start with a basic levitation spell. Try to levitate the dish you just served me!
Wizard Ghost: Close your eyes, and imagine it floating slowly upwards. As if it is weightless, similar to you and I...
<<emotionChange Magic>>
Wizard Ghost: <wiggle> Aha! </wiggle>
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Wizard Ghost: You've done- Huh?
<<emotionChange Sad>>
Wizard Ghost: What do you mean, you "just picked it up"?
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Wizard Ghost: Nonsense, mortal, be proud of your magical abilities! You are not my apprentice for nothing!
Wizard Ghost: No need to fear, though, as the next lesson shall be much more challenging! <wiggle> Tis was a mere warmup! </wiggle>
<<emotionChange None Sparkles>>
Wizard Ghost: I shall teach you something that has never been seen before, and is sure to change your entire existence!
<<emotionChange None>>
Wizard Ghost: Until then!

Wizard Ghost: My dear mortal, let us begin most important lesson of all!
<<emotionChange None Sparkles>>
Wizard Ghost: Today, I will be introducing you to... necromancy!
<<emotionChange Sad>>
Wizard Ghost: To be completely honest with you, er... I have never successfully performed the necromancy ritual.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Wizard Ghost: But I know the process, and will teach it to you! First, think of your past life, and one thing you truly loved about it.
Wizard Ghost: Then, think of something you truly despised about it - <wiggle>I can think of a number of ideas for this one.</wiggle>
<<emotionChange Magic>>
Wizard Ghost: Then, with all the honesty in your heart, say the words <italic>volo vivere</italic>.
<<emotionChange Normal>>
Wizard Ghost: You shall feel a change in your spirit if you have performed it correctly.
Wizard Ghost: ...
Wizard Ghost: Ah. It seems that the ritual has failed yet again.
Wizard Ghost: Well, no matter, my dear apprentice - Even a wizard such as I cannot truly understand why the ritual fails.
<<emotionChange Sad>>
Wizard Ghost: But I do have my suspicions - For myself, at least.
Wizard Ghost: It becomes... incredibly difficult for me to find reasons I loved my past life each time I attempt the ritual.
Wizard Ghost: And when I do find the reasons, they appear incredibly... trivial, compared to what I spent most of my life doing.
Wizard Ghost: I was not a wizard in my past life, but with each passing day, I wished that I was.
Wizard Ghost: I yearned for control over my own destiny that I could never have - I only found it in my silly dreams of wizardry.
Wizard Ghost: But alas, not everyone's life is meant to be what they desire. Or at least, that is what I have assured myself. Ah...

Wizard Ghost: Hello, dear mortal!
Wizard Ghost: It is I, Emrys - Unfortunately, it seems I have run out of lessons to teach you, and thus, we have reached the end of your apprenticeship.
<<emotionChange None Flowers>>
Wizard Ghost: I have known you for a short time, but I truly believe you are the most gifted apprentice I could ever have taken on.
Wizard Ghost: And truly, I am thankful that I have finally met someone willing to place their trust in me, and my sorcery - Thank you.
Wizard Ghost: I hope, above all else, that you are finding fulfillment, brewing tea and baking pastries for us ghosts.
<<emotionChange None>>
Wizard Ghost: Is that what you desired in life, too? Or is it a new journey? Ah, no matter - I trust you to continue what makes you happy.
Wizard Ghost: As for myself, well... Ever since our last session, I have been deep in thought.
Wizard Ghost: And now, I have decided to swear off necromancy. Our lesson made me realize that perhaps, I have been holding too tightly onto regrets from a life bygone, despite becoming what I so desperately wanted to be back then.
<<emotionChange None Sparkles>>
Wizard Ghost: I, Emrys Alistair Artemis Evander - <wiggle>perhaps I should shorten some of my names</wiggle> - am a wizard, and I am in control over my own destiny!
Wizard Ghost: Now, I shall continue my journey to discover all of this realm's secrets, and share the joys of magic with every soul I can find!
<<emotionChange None>>
Wizard Ghost: And perhaps, once I learn enough, I can return to this humble cafe, and teach you all I know once again, dear mortal.
<<emotionChange Sad>>
Wizard Ghost: I admit, I will miss our talks of sorcery over coffee for as long as we are separated.
<<emotionChange Normal Sparkles>>
Wizard Ghost: But this is not goodbye - In fact, this is only the start of our journey!
Wizard Ghost: So, until next time, my dear mortal - Take care of yourself, and remember that the great Emrys will always be watching over you.
