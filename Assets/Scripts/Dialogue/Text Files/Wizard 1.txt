Dear mortal, please fetch me an {item} with arcane energy befitting a powerful sorcerer! (That would be me, of course.)
[End]

[Success]
Ah, this is incredible! This {item} has shown me its true power! I must thank you, dear mortal! 
[End]

[Failure]
Gah! This {item} reeks of a curse! Are you trying to damper my powers, dear mortal?! You must be more careful with your tonics!
[End]

[Story]
Ah, you want to know about me, dear mortal? Ohoho, I'm glad you've asked!
You may call me <wiggle> Emrys, master of the arcane arts! </wiggle>
Say, have you ever thought about doing an apprenticeship in sorcery? I can show you the world in its purest form!
Spectacle!
Discovery!
Third adjective!
Yes, yes, I see it now - The look in your eyes!
You want to be my pupil, no? Ah, wait - You are skeptical of who I say I am!
Yes, yes, a fair choice to be wary. But, I promise you, dear mortal, that I am truthful about my knowledge of this world.
In fact, when I return to this cafe, I shall show you some of my teachings!
That will prove my status, and will empower you to unlock your true potential!
I must be going now, but I shall see you again soon, dear mortal!
[End]


[Story]
Hello once again, dear mortal! It is I, Emrys, yet again!
Are you ready to begin your first lesson?
Today, I shall teach you… spellcasting!
We shall start with a basic levitation spell. Try to levitate the dish you just served me!
Close your eyes, and imagine it floating slowly upwards. As if it is weightless, similar to you and I…
Aha!
You've done- Huh?
What do you mean, you "just picked it up"?
Nonsense, mortal, be proud of your magical abilities! You are not my apprentice for nothing!
No need to fear, though, as the next lesson shall be much more challenging!
Be prepared, dear mortal!
[End]


[Story]
Dear mortal, it is I! Yet again!
What a pleasure it is to see my apprentice doing so well!
Now, I did say this lesson would be more challenging - I challenge you to adorn this dish with a fitting magical rune!
No need to worry, though. You have proven yourself capable of the task!
…
Aha! My apprentice has done it yet again!
As you can see, oftentimes crafting runes is not a matter of planning!
When your heart is set on a certain rune, your body shall follow - Just like in our realm!
Planning only serves to hold you back, my dear mortal!
We only have a limited time in any plane of existence, and getting caught up in dreadful numbers and statistics is only a plague on your natural talent!
Ahem, perhaps I have grown too philosophical for one lesson.
Well, no matter!
Be excited for our next session, dear mortal! I shall teach you something that has never been seen before, and is sure to change your entire existence!
Until then!
[End]


[Story]
My dear mortal, I have returned for your most important lesson of all!
Today, I will be introducing you to… necromancy!
To be completely honest with you, er… I have never successfully performed the necromancy ritual.
But I know the process, and will teach it to you! First, think of your past life, and one thing you truly loved about it.
Then, think of something you truly despised about it - <wiggle>I can think of a number of ideas for this one.</wiggle>
Then, with all the honesty in your heart, say the words <italic>volo vivere</italic>.
You shall feel a change in your spirit if you have performed it correctly.
…
Ah. It seems that the ritual has failed yet again.
Well, no matter, my dear apprentice - Even a wizard such as I cannot truly understand why the ritual fails.
But I do have my suspicions - For myself, at least.
It becomes… incredibly difficult for me to find reasons I loved my past life each time I attempt the ritual.
And when I do find the reasons, they appear incredibly… trivial, compared to what I spent most of my life doing.
I was not a wizard in my past life, but with each passing day, I wished that I was.
I yearned for control over my own destiny that I could never have - I only found it in my silly dreams of wizardry.
But alas, not everyone's life is meant to be what they desire. Or at least, that is what I have assured myself. Ah…
[End]


[Story]
Hello, dear mortal!
It is I, Emrys - Unfortunately, it seems I have run out of lessons to teach you, and thus, we have reached the end of your apprenticeship.
I have known you for a short time, but I truly believe you are the most gifted apprentice I could ever have taken on.
And truly, I am thankful that I have finally met someone willing to place their trust in me, and my sorcery - Thank you.
I hope, above all else, that you are finding fulfillment, brewing coffee for us ghosts.
Is that what you desired in life, too? Or is it a new journey? Ah, no matter - I trust you to continue what makes you happy.
As for myself, well… Ever since our last session, I have been deep in thought.
And now, I have decided to swear off necromancy. Our lesson made me realize that perhaps, I have been holding too tightly onto regrets from a life bygone, despite becoming what I so desperately wanted to be back then.
I, Emrys Alistair Artemis Evander - <wiggle>perhaps I should shorten some of my names</wiggle> - am a wizard, and I am in control over my own destiny!
I am no longer shackled to graphs and statistics!
Now, I shall continue my journey to discover all of this realm's secrets, and share the joys of magic with every soul I can find!
And perhaps, once I learn enough, I can return to this humble cafe, and teach you all I know once again, dear mortal.
I admit, I will miss our talks of sorcery over coffee for as long as we are separated.
But this is not goodbye - In fact, this is only the start of our journey!
So, until next time, my dear mortal - Take care of yourself, and remember that the great Emrys will always be watching over you.
[End]
