Hmm… I need something to get my creative juices flowing. Get me something that’ll put a pep in my step, like a catchy pop song. How about a {item}?

Wow – this {item} hits all the right notes!

This tastes… off-key…

What was that? 
Sorry, my hearing isn’t as good as it used to be. 
Honestly, I thought dying would fix my bad ear, but that ringing in my right ear is annoying as ever.
At first, I thought it was just fatigue – maybe my late nights of practicing were getting to me. But, over time, the noise kept getting worse, reverberating into my passions.
It drove me crazy not knowing whether my performances were in the wrong key, and every practice session fell flat.
It’s been a while since I’ve put on a performance, but I’d like to think I’m a good inspiration away from getting back to my peak.

Honestly, when I lost half of my hearing, it felt like my world was out-of-sync.
My motivation started slipping, and my frustration grew.
Despite that, I still thought I could keep going like nothing happened.
But days turned into weeks turned into months, and I had nothing to show for it.
I couldn’t put on a performance like I used to. Over time, I started losing my composure.
I became… obsessed with the way people viewed my music.
After all, music was my world – what’s a person got to stand on when their world crumbles around them?

Losing my hearing wasn’t all minor, though.
Have you ever met someone and you’re both thinking in harmony?
For me, that was Jock Ghost. Meeting him felt like getting the band back together – we rode the same highs, felt the same pain, and shared the same tears.
It was cathartic being able to meet someone who really understood bathing in the limelight… then waking up one day to realize that the world had moved on without us.

Something Jock Ghost said struck a chord in me:
“Yknow, I used to compete a lot. Every time I stepped up to that first-place square, I’d strike a sick pose. I thought that all those cheers, all the medals I got, those were what made it all worth it. But… looking back? I think I just loved the game for what it was.”
For the first time since I’d started falling, I had a moment of clarity.
I stopped thinking about what I had lost and instead focused on what I had in the first place.
What’s a person got to stand on when their world crumbles around them?
Only themselves.
Just like Jock Ghost didn’t need medals to prove that he was a sportsman, I didn’t need chart-toppers or huge audiences to prove that I was a musician.
It was the passion that drove us to become those things, and I think I’m ready to start playing music again – for nobody but myself.
