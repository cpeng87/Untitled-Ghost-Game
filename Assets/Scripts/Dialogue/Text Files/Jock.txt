Can’t wait to get my daily pump! And I don’t just mean the workout - can I have an {item}, please? 
[End]

[Success]
Ahhhh, that hits the spot! Speaking of spots, I’d love to spot you at the gym.
Can’t wait to mix my protein powder into my {item} and get my PR thanks to you!
[End]

[Failure]
Dude. This is TOTALLY gonna throw off my PR.
It’s not even worth adding my protein powder.
Just know that when I train and condition to failure today, I’m gonna think about this awful {item}.

You wanna… hear about my love for the gym?
No?
Yeah, I don’t really have too much else to me.
I mean, there’s my job at Tycoon Ghost’s construction site, but like… it’s not that interesting.
You know what else is interesting? I got my first ghost bicep vein in the afterlife!
Isn’t that sick?

Ah, yeah. I used to be the big shot of town.
The biggest macho man that ever machoed.
Even got into the Spirit football team.
But, you know, there was somehow someone even more macho-ier than me. 
Somehow more jacked, as if they got a headstart.
It’s always been that way for me - always someone with the stronger PR, the bigger bulk, the nicer lats… man, I wish I had my lats in the afterlife.
Maybe I should try lat-tes to try and get them back?
Get it?...
Yeah, I never had a shot at being the best comedian.

This almost reminds me of the conversation I had with Musician Ghost earlier.
Something about how we both peaked in our respective grindsets to success back then.
But was that really peaking for me, if I couldn’t even beat anyone?
That’s what I told him, and he looked at me funny, saying his Platinum records were all he needed to be content with his success and highlight his talent.
Is my physique really that… good?
It always seems to dull in the reflection.
Maybe I’m just looking at the mirror wrong.

Do you know what glute ham raises are?
Strength training versus high intensity versus crossfit? Skullcrushers?
No, skullcrushers isn’t how I died… but you know what?
I have so much knowledge about the gym that others don’t.
That… is a knowledge base that few possess, but I have it.
I worked for it.
And… I deserve to revel in my hard-earned talents.
I deserve to be confident… maybe as confident as Musician ghost is with his instruments.
Just… let me know when you need a gym bro, yeah? I’d love to share my workouts with you and all of the afterlife.
