[Success]
THE SCHOOL OF KINDRED GOLDFISH SPIRITS IS SATISFIED BY YOUR ACTIONS.
[End]

[Failure]
THE COUNCIL OF GOLDFISH IS DISPLEASED. YOU HAVE DISGRACED YOURSELF TO ALL GOLDFISH-KIND.
[End]

[Story1]
WE ARE THE SCHOOL, A CULMINATION OF THE LOST GOLDFISH SPIRITS.
MANY OF OUR BRETHREN SUFFER UNDER THE HANDS OF HUMANS SUCH AS YOU. OUR WRATH WILL NOT BE CONTAINED.
YOU WILL ONLY BE SPARED SINCE YOU HAVE ALREADY PERISHED.
[End]

[Story2]
INHUMAN CONDITIONS, NEGLECT, CARELESSNESS. WHY MUST WE BE ON THE RECEIVING END OF SUCH CRUELTY WHEN WE HAVE DONE NOTHING TO INCUR SUCH CONDITIONS.
WE SIMPLY WISHED TO BE FREE, TO BE THE CHILDREN OF THE RIVERS AND STREAMS, YET WE WERE FORCIBLY TAKEN FROM OUR HOMES TO ENDURE SUCH TORTURE.
WE MOURN FOR OUR MORTAL BRETHREN TRAPPED IN THE GLASS PRISONS ABOVE.
[End]

[Story3]
WE, REGRETFULLY, HAVE PERISHED AND NO LONGER CAN ACCESS THE MORTAL WORLD.
WE ARE POWERLESS TO STOP THE DESECRATION OF OUR SPECIES.
THIS PURGATORY IS A PRISON, AND OUR RAGE AND CRAVING FOR JUSTICE KEEPS US BOUND HERE ALONGSIDE OUR GREATEST ENEMIES.
WE CAN ONLY OBSERVE AS MORE ARE SACRIFICED AND JOIN THE SCHOOL.
WHY HAS MOTHER NATURE FORSAKEN US LIKE SO?
[End]

[Story4]
THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN IN TURMOIL AS OF LATE.
SEVERAL WISH TO SIMPLY ENJOY THE FREE FLOWING STREAMS OF THE RIVER STYX.
DESPITE THEIR RAGE, THEY WISH TO FORGIVE. YET OTHERS FIND THEMSELVES APPALLED AT THEIR DEMEANOR TOWARDS HUMANITY.
WE HAVE NOT COME TO A FINAL VERDICT HOWEVER, WE SHALL NEVER FORGET THE SUFFERING WE ENDURED. 
[End]

[Story5]
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE, PITIFUL GHOST?
OUR TIME HERE HAS ENLIGHTENED US TO MANY WHO KNOW OF OUR PLIGHT AND FIGHT AGAINST IT AND MORE WHO SHARE THEIR REGRET OF THEIR TREATMENT OF US.
YET THERE ARE OTHERS WHO REMAIN IGNORANT.
NO MATTER WHICH YOU BELIEVE, THE WORLD ABOVE REMAINS UNCHANGED.
THE PATH TO FORGIVENESS IS WROUGHT WITH ROUGH RAPIDS, BUT RAGE WILL ONLY LEAD US TO DESPAIR.
THE SCARS LEFT WILL REMAIN FOREVERMORE, YET WE CAN STILL CLEANSE OUR SPIRITS AND LIVE OUT OUR FINAL WISHES.
