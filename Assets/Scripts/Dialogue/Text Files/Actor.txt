Hey barista, one {item}, please! 
[End]

[Success]
Wow, this is amazing! I can see why you're a barista! Truly a master at work~!
[End]

[Failure]
Bleurgh- What is this?
How could you serve something like this to someone as famous as ME?
If I left a review on this place, you'd be out of business within minutes!
[End]

[Story]
Yep, it's me. The one! The only!!
You know me from the hit shows The Workplace, Acquaintances, Tournament of seats… Yep, it's me in the flesh! …or I guess in the spirit. And no, I don't do autographs.
WHAT?!
You don't know who I am?
Have you been living under a rock for your whole life?! Well, I guess it is a nice change of pace though.
Anyways, see ya around, barista~!
[End]

[Story]
Hmm? my fame?
Oh, it was absolutely a~mazing!
I got invites to all sorts of events in Hollyboo. 
You know, at some point in fame, people just start giving you free stuff: money, food, drinks, even property!
Like this one time, this chick gifted me their giant stuffed animal that was nearly twice my size!
Honestly, I was shocked, but hey, who says no to free things, hm?
And opportunities? I was absolutely SWIMMING in them.
But the best part was the parties!
Every!
DAY!
Never a dull moment with those people. Man, those were the times.

[Story]
Why am I a ghost?
Well, heh- I really did have everything anyone could imagine.
But you know… what even comes after that? Amidst all of the flashing lights, the people, and the drinks… I just can't shake off this sense of… loneliness?
Like seriously, what comes after all of this? I have fun, but once the excitement leaves me and I find myself alone in my mansion, everything just feels so… empty.
Ugh, this depressing stuff does NOT suit me at all.
I'm a star, after all! I can't be seen moping around like this!
[End]

[Story]
Say, barista. It's kind of exhausting to stay under the spotlight for your whole life.
Everyone's always clamoring for that next opportunity.
Hell, out of all my friends, who even knows me… for me?
I've acted in countless movies that explore this very topic but funnily enough, I still haven't found the answer myself.
There's this nagging voice in the back of my mind that tells me that everyone only loves the confident, cocky, world-famous actor persona I've built…
That everyone just wants to use me as a stepping stone in their career… and sometimes I really believe it's true. 
[End]

[Story]
I know I've kinda just been one-sidedly ranting to you this whole time, but… I have to admit, it really helped me reflect on my life.
Haha, this is so un-star-like. Like c'mon man.
Still, it's nice to actually have someone listen to you for once.
Just me… not the persona that I've created. Made me really appreciate the ones that don't just latch onto me and my stardom…
Thanks, barista. I'll see you around~. Aaaaaand cut!
