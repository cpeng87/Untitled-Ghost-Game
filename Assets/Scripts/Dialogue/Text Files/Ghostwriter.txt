Ugh, I’ve got writer’s block again… Oh, sorry, just one {item} please.
[End]

[Success]
Oh, wow, this is delicious! You’re like… a magical barista! Oh- that’s a new idea, I should write that down quickly…
[End]

[Failure]
That’s a… creative way of interpreting that…
[End]

[Story]
Oh, wait… you’re talking to me?
Yes! Hi!! I see you run this cafe- I wrote a story about a cafe romance once, you know?
It wasn’t anything great, and I wasn’t happy with it… But, cafe stories are all the rage nowadays, so my author said it would sell…
Oh, not that I’m some money-chaser or anything!
It’s just, well… I also need to eat…
[End]

[Story]
Your cafe is really great!
I used to come to places like this all~ the time to write.
The author I worked for also liked cafes, so we often met over coffee or something.
What?
Oh, my author? Well, I am a ghostwriter, after all.
I write the work, my author puts her name on it, and it gets shipped out!
I’m quite fine with this, of course! I don’t do well with fame and the spotlight and all that… Yeah.
[End]

[Story]
Hey, I'm kinda curious. Have you ever read anything I’ve written?
Maybe “Battle and Tranquility”? Or “Small Cottage on the Meadow”?
Oh, yes! I wrote those! 
I’m so happy you know them, I loved writing those so much~!
D-did do you recognize my name? I was listed as, uh… an editor on those books, I think… under the acknowledgements, for sure!
No…? …Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. No one remembers anyone except the author… haha…
[End]

[Story]
Hi again!
Hm? you want to know why I kept ghostwriting instead of publishing?
Well, you see… when I first started as a writer, I couldn’t get anyone to publish my work.
None of my works got any offers, even though I just really, really wanted for people to be able to read my work.
I didn’t care that it was under a different name, at the time.
I-I’m not sure when I suddenly started caring.
[End]

[Story]
Hey, I thought about it more, and… I think I did actually want recognition.
I wanted so badly to talk to the people I’ve inspired, to be able to speak publicly about my experience writing, to see that I had done something for the world, and to have other people tell me that too…
And, well… I’m still frustrated about it.
That I never got to do that- that I never had the courage to become an author all on my own.
But… maybe it’s not too late?
[End]

[Story]
Hey, do you think I should start writing again?
No one will read it but ghosts, of course, but… I really miss writing.
Sometimes, I forget why I became a writer in the first place. It wasn’t for money, or fame, or recognition- even if that’s what I died wishing for.
I just wanted to write, and for someone to read my work and feel inspired.
And people did, right? Lots of people! Even if it wasn’t under my name.
Maybe… that’s enough.
Maybe, now that I can write under my own name, I’ll feel like it’s enough.
[End]

[Story]
Hey, Cafe Ghost! This might be the last time I see you, so here. It’s my new book!
I just published it today, under my own name this time. I wanted you to be the first to read it.
I owe a lot to you for listening to me talk. It might not seem like much to you, but it helped me a bunch.
I’ve done everything I wanted, really, and I think it’s time I let myself be happy with what I’ve accomplished.
I hope you like my book!
