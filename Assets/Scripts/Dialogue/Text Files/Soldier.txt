<shaky>Argh…</shaky> My headache is flaring up again… I should go…
[End]

[Story]
Excuse me… But do you know where I am…?
I… I can’t seem to remember who or where I am… I’ve been having this terrible headache ever since… Ever since what…?
Anyways, thank you for the drink… It’s helping to soothe my headache, even if it’s only a little.
My name is… What was it…?
It looks like I’m dressed like a soldier so… I guess you can call me Soldier Ghost.

[Story]
The war… <shaky>The war…!</shaky>
How… how did I forget about the war? How is the war right now?
Are… Are we winning…?
You… You don’t know about the war…?
How is that possible… This is one of the largest wars we’ve had since the Continental War!
A war that I… barely made a difference in… I was hoping to have changed this time but… I guess I’m just not good enough…
Like look at me. I’m back here, forced to recover just because of a headache that I got from… What did I get it from again…? 
[End]

[Story]
Ah… That’s right…
Doctor Ghost was telling me about a soldier who saved their life when they were only a child…
I wish I could be like that soldier… At this rate, the war will be over by the time I recover.
I… I need to hurry up and get better faster.
If it weren’t for this headache then maybe I could go back to the front lines.
I… Didn’t have the greatest childhood… But if I can leave something behind… some kind of legacy or maybe some victory…
Maybe my life will have worth living.

[Story]
Oh, I found a dog tag in my pocket the other day. The name faded out but it felt… familiar to me.
When I look at this dog tag, I get vague memories of the battlefield…
I remember scenes of gunfire and explosions everywhere… I could faintly remember the smell of steel and blood. I was on foot but… 
Why does that seem so off…
I saw… an enemy pointing their gun at a child, but their face is eluding me right now…
All I remember is tackling that enemy and pinning them down to let that kid escape…
I hope that child got out safely…
The enemy surrounded me after that before… Well, I shouldn’t talk about something like that in a cafe…
[End]

[Story]
I-I remember now…
I-I was a pilot in the war but… I was shot down before I could do anything significant…That’s why I was on the ground…
But… that child I saved…
Apparently it was Doctor Ghost!
They recognized my dog tag when I showed it to them.
I’m… so glad they got away safely… Doctor Ghost wanted to thank me for saving him but… I just did what anyone else would’ve done. 
Thank you for giving me these drinks, they helped me remember something important.
Something I can proudly take with me to the next life.
