Can I get a {item}? Hurry, please, I need to get back on my ranked grind, ASAP.
[End]

[Success]
Sweet! This is just what I need to fuel my gamer focus!
[End]

[Failure]
Eugh, gross! Barista diff for real, bro, just ff already…

[Story]
Y'know, you're actually speaking to a Grandmaster player.
What?
You don't know what that means?
Heh…normies…you wouldn't understand.
I'm going to be a huge pro gamer someday.
If you ever want to play sometime, we can duo queue. I'll carry you, don't worry.

[Story]
I was the president of my high school anime club, so I know what I'm saying when I tell you that…you're strong.
Stand proud.
What, nothing?
My genius is wasted on you.
I don't know why I'm spending precious time here talking to you, anyways.
I need to hit Challenger, I'm so close to it.
Then, maybe my dad will…nevermind.
[End]

[Story]
I wonder if I'll ever see my dad around, in the afterlife.
I mean, I'm fine even if he doesn't!
I have my waifu Seraphine to keep me company.
Just…it'd be nice to have his attention, for once.
Anyways, once I hit Challenger, he'll have to pay attention to me! I'll be famous. I'll be everywhere, on TV and everything. Just watch!
[End]

[Story]
Why do I want to be Challenger?
Well, loads of reasons, obviously! I'll be super famous so my dad will see me on TV, I'll make loads of money so my dad won't have to work, and I'll get loads of ladies so my dad won't think I'm lonely!
And, well…he was proud of me when I hit silver, wasn't he? And silver's nothing.
Low elo.
Just imagine how much more proud he'll be when I hit the highest tier. 
[End]

[Story]
I…uh, I met my dad the other day.
He, he wanted to apologize to me?
And he said…he was proud of me.
Even though I'm not Challenger, or a pro gamer, or have a girlfriend.
So, um. I don't think I'll be able to carry you anymore, if you do want to play.
I…I want to make the most of my time with my dad.
[End]

[Story]
I think I might be leaving soon. Just a gut feeling, I guess.
I thought I was here to hit Challenger, but honestly?
Hall of Heroes doesn't even seem that important anymore, now that my dad's here with me.
So….you know how it is. GG go next.
I hope you find what you're looking for, whatever it is.
