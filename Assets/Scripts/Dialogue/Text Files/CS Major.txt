Urgh… one {item}, please… I need to fuel my SoulCode grind somehow…
[End]

[Success]
This somehow makes me feel something…? I think you pulled me out of my sleep deprivation coma. Thanks.
[End]

I… how could you betray me like this. I’m… a broke college student, you know?
Now my tuition money has gone to waste!!
I can’t believe I spent my savings on this and got nothing but a treat that's more lifeless than me…
[End]

Yeah… I’ve been told to touch grass more.
I’m not really ready to go run around and play in the fields or whatever “normal” people do, but I’ve heard socializing is a good start to get out of the slump I was in.
I’m CS Major ghost… at least as far as I remember.
The grind’s been hard, but apparently it was good enough to put me here… ish?
I’m not too sure, though… I’ve been busy catching up on sleep now that I have the time.
It’s been… nice, but I don’t really know what to do from here.
Anyway, it was good chatting with you. Maybe I’ll use our conversation in the next application I create… if I ever decide to create again.

You know, I cut out a bunch of things to make time for CS.
Who cares about sleep when you have SoulCode, grades, and 5 projects to worry about?
I mean, I didn’t just need the degree- I needed a guaranteed job. 
I… think I got my degree? I'm not sure, I blacked out and ended up here before I could even process what was going on.
Anyway, I tried to look into technology while I was down here, but there are no jobs to be had… So what’s the point?
I mean, I can still use my laptop to make things… but why would I? And now, without CS driving me anywhere… what do I do?
No, seriously- what do I do? You want me to… pfft… be in a play?? Go do arts and crafts?? Hah! I’m a CS Major, how could I possibly be creative??
Hah… haha… hah… how can I even find something to do if my only skill is useless here?
Eh, whatever… time to go crash at home. That’s enough touching grass for today.

[Story]
Oh God, how does one talk to women?
I always dreamed of getting all the women in the world, and, since I’m dead… I might as well try everything I can to fill in the void.
Just gotta replace grinding SoulCode for… uh… farming women…?
No, I probably shouldn’t say that… uh… How does one talk to women?
See, this is why I turned to CS. Computers are so much easier to understand.
Maybe because they’re just machines that do what I want, and I just wanted to play God and be someone in control of everything.
Wow… I sound like a Philosophy major. No, I’m a CS major… but I’m dead, physically and mentally. And Computer Science is useless here.
Anyway, women.
How does one… hm… actually, the effects of my sleep deprivation are really strong right now.
I’ll figure out how to talk to women from GhostTube tutorials or something… it shouldn’t be that hard, right?
[End]

[Story]
I think I’m crashing out.
I realize i've associated traits like introspection and creativity to other majors and mocked them so I could feel better about my own CS major path.
And what does my CS major entail, exactly?
Me working myself to the bone until I died??
I BLACKED OUT, Cafe Ghost!!!
I blacked out from stress and pain and overexertion and… I RUINED myself and programmed myself to feel NOTHING except a falsified ego over a major that drove me to neglect self-care, self-preservation, and self-meaning!!!
Who… who the heck am I?
What is my purpose??
What do I do when my one and only ambition gets stolen out of my hands???
Now I understand why people try to escape from the world… When you have nothing, you have to cope somehow and make a desperate attempt for control in your life, and now I have to cope with the reality that the world I built is meaningless.
I guess I escaped anyway, but… what the heck do I do??
Yeah… you know what? I’m just going to go back home and stare at the wall. I can’t do this right now.
[End]

[Story]
…Okay, so I talked to the Reaper.
They talked about… self-love.
I think I neglected that and the people in my life for my academics, and now I have no social intelligence or social life in general.
That void inside me… I filled it with the CS major grind, but to what avail?
Heh, Actor Ghost taught me that phrase.
Talking to the Humanities majors- I mean, the experts in the Arts- made me realize how much joy they have. They aren’t as consumed by their studies and growth, unlike me.
I think it also made me realize why I chose Computer Science in the first place. I love problem-solving!
In fact, I can still problem-solve here at the construction site or any one of Tycoon Ghost’s buildings… I just get to apply my knowledge differently.
And maybe… slowly… I can get my joy back. By giving myself as much time as I need to finish the things I like to do, rather than always being pressed for time to complete assignments I may not even want to do in the first place.
Maybe… breaks are okay.
And… I should make more time for myself.
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go outside and talk to my… acquaintances? Friends? Yeah… hopefully we’ll be friends soon. Thanks for everything.
