Success: This…! Wow, this is… hmph! You're lucky I'm even paying for it!

[Failure]
Failure: What is this?! DISGUSTING!!! I want you FIRED! Who is your boss?!? …You're self employed?
[End]

[Story1]
Well, I certainly don't see what all the fuss is about. This looks like any old raggedy coffee shop to me.
[End]

[Story2]
I'm only here because the other cafes always mess up my order. Hmph! Don't get a big head about it.
[End]

[Story3]
How I died?? Do you have no manners?!? Not that it's any of your business, but I was… left behind… during a camping trip. And… I didn't have a way out of the forest.
There, happy?
[End]

[Story4]
Why I'm still here? …I guess I was just waiting for someone to come find me.
Not that it matters, anyways. I'm a ghost now, and anyone who might've come for me is probably dead, too.
